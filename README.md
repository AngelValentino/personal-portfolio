## üß™ Local Development

The portfolio was fully designed and built by me, from layout to logic. You are welcome to use it as a base for your own project. Just a mention would be appreciated.

It's open source because I believe in sharing, especially with so few accessible, vanilla stack portfolios out there. If it was helpful, that is what matters most.

To use it locally for development, you can clone the repository from GitHub and open it with a Live Server (such as the VS Code extension) to see real-time updates as you work.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AngelValentino/personal-portfolio.git
```

## üå± Personal Portfolio: Evolution, Features and Limitations

### A Simple Yet Modern and Accessible Portfolio

- **Goal**: A simple and accessible portfolio, responsive across all screen sizes, and easy to read and interact with.
- **Crafted with care**: Every aspect of the portfolio, from the frontend to interactive features, was thoughtfully developed following best practices, with a strong focus on accessibility, performance, and user-centered design.
- **Accessible Event Handling**: The toggle modal events function was implemented to add the necessary accessible event listeners. This function is a streamlined version of the event handler used in [taskflow](https://github.com/AngelValentino/TaskFlow), providing adequate functionality for a project of this scope.

### Current Limitations

Although the portfolio uses a mix of programming patterns and best practices, they were kept as simple as possible, without relying on an MVC architecture or similar. This makes the codebase simpler, but it also limits scalability. To scale this project effectively, it would need to be refactored into MVC or another architectural pattern.

Notwithstanding, there are no current plans to update this portfolio, as it's considered to already fulfill its purpose in a clear, accessible, and responsive way.

### Accessibility (a11y)

- **Inclusive Design**: The portfolio is built with inclusivity in mind, ensuring the interface is intuitive and easy to navigate for all users, including those with disabilities.
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support allows users to navigate and interact with all features without relying on a mouse or touch input.
- **ARIA Support**: ARIA attributes are applied judiciously to enhance accessibility without overcomplicating the markup, ensuring smooth interaction with screen readers and other assistive technologies.
- **Semantic HTML**: Semantic HTML elements are used throughout to improve both accessibility and SEO, enabling assistive technologies to accurately interpret the content structure.
- **Multilingual Support and Accessible Language Selector**: The portfolio includes a fully accessible custom selector that lets users easily switch between options using keyboard and screen reader support.
- **Theme Accessibility**: The dark and light theme toggle improves user comfort and accessibility.

### Architecture Overview

- **Modular Design**: The portfolio is developed with a clean modular architecture, using ES module imports and exports to ensure maintainability and scalability.
- **Lightweight and Dependency-Free**: Built with vanilla JavaScript and pure CSS, the project avoids heavy libraries or frameworks, focusing on simplicity and performance. Combines procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming techniques for simplicity and flexibility.
- **Performance-Focused**: Minimal dependencies and clean code contribute to fast loading times and a smooth user experience across all devices.
